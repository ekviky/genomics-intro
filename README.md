# genomics-intro
An introduction to genomics aimed at intermediate/advanced undergraduate biology majors.

To get your feet wet in all things genomics, this lecture includes a quick spin through several of the latest hot-off-the press genomics applications, then a tour of the [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/) platform for bioinformatics. 

To do:
add links to papers from lecture
include additional sources like [brief guide](https://www.genome.gov/18016863/a-brief-guide-to-genomics/)
genomicists are people and we can do better as pointed out [here](http://www.nature.com/news/genomics-is-failing-on-diversity-1.20759)
