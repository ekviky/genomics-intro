# genomics-intro
An introduction to genomics aimed at intermediate/advanced undergraduate biology majors.

To get your feet wet in all things genomics, this module includes a lecture providing quick spin through several of the latest hot-off-the press genomics applications, and in lab we'll take a tour of the [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/) platform for bioinformatics. 

To do:
- add links to papers from lecture


Genomicists are people and we can do better as pointed out [here](http://www.nature.com/news/genomics-is-failing-on-diversity-1.20759)
