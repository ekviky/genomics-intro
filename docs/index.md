# An Introduction to Genomics

### Overview of module

In this lecture we will have a brief introduction to the technologies providing big data in genomics, followed by a series of vignettes to illustrate the impact of genomics on virtually all aspects of our daily lives. The second class will involve a hands-on tour of genomics applications using the Galaxy platform for bioinformatics analysis.

What is genomics? A genome is the entire set of DNA within a cell, so naturally genomics is the study of all things related to DNA - genes, chromosomes, modifications, organelles, episomes, and much, much more. Genomics subfields come in many flavors from functional, structural, evolutionary, population, clinical, cancer, to meta-, epi-, and beyond!

What is Galaxy? [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/) is an open-source bioinformatics platform for transparent, reproducible, collaborative data-driven science. Use the main server instance, or better yet - get the source [code](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy) for your own local instance.

### Tutorial

Have a play with genomic data yourself! The step-by-step guide, data, and histories used for the in-class lab exercise are available [here](https://usegalaxy.org/u/kvik/p/prabi-demo).
