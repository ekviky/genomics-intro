# Welcome to An Introduction to Genomics



In this lecture we will take a quick spin through the latest hot-off-the press genomics applications, then a tour of the Galaxy platform for bioinformatics.

What is Galaxy? [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/) is an open-source bioinformatics platform for transparent, reproducible, collaborative data-driven science. Use the main server instance, or better yet - get the source [code](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy) for your own local instance.

Have a play with genomic data yourself! The [demo](https://usegalaxy.org/u/kvik/p/prabi-demo) used in class is available.
