# An Introduction to Genomics



In this lecture we will have a **brief** introduction to the technologies providing big data in genomics, followed by a series of vignettes to illustrate the impact of genomics on virtually all aspects of our daily lives, capped off with a tour of the Galaxy platform for bioinformatics analysis.

What is genomics? A genome is the entire set of DNA within a cell, so naturally genomics is the study of all things related to DNA - genes, chromosomes, modifications, organelles, episomes, and much, much more. Genomics subfields come in many flavors from functional, structural, evolutionary, population, clinical, cancer, to meta-, epi-, and beyond!

What is Galaxy? [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/) is an open-source bioinformatics platform for transparent, reproducible, collaborative data-driven science. Use the main server instance, or better yet - get the source [code](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy) for your own local instance.

Have a play with genomic data yourself! The step-by-step guide, data, and histories used for the demo in class are available [here](https://usegalaxy.org/u/kvik/p/prabi-demo). Want more? Check out the plethora of [tutorials](http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/) on everything 'omics' from NGS, RNA-seq, to chip-seq, and more.
